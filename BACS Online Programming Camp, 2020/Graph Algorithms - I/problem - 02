Walking in a Tree 

You have to start from the root and visit each node at least once. The cost of traversing each edge is one.
If any edge is visited multiple times, the cost will occur for each time. Minimize the total cost.

Variation 1 : Must return to the starting  node AKA root.(Simple DFS)
Variation 2 : journey can end at any node.(Max Distance)
variation 3 : start at any node and end at any node.(Diameter)
