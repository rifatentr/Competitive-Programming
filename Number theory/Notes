    We find number of trailing zero using the following steps:
        Factorize the base B
        If B = pa11 × pa22…× pakk, then find out occurance of xi=factorialPrimePower(pi).
        But we can’t use xi directly. In order to create B we will need to combine each pi into paii. So we divide each xi by ai.
            Number of trailing zero is MIN(x1,x2,…,xk).

Eulers Phi Properties..
    
    1. If p is a prime number, then gcd(p,q)=1 for all 1≤q<p. Therefore we have:
    ϕ(p)=p−1.
    2. If p is a prime number and k≥1, then there are exactly pk/p numbers between 1 and pk that are divisible by p. Which gives us:
    ϕ(p^k)=p^k−p^k−1.
    3. If a and b are relatively prime, then:
        ϕ(ab)=ϕ(a)⋅ϕ(b).
    4. In general, for not coprime a and b, the equation
            ϕ(ab)=ϕ(a)⋅ϕ(b)⋅dϕ(d)
            with d=gcd(a,b) holds.

  Fibonacci properties...
        
     1 . Cassini's identity:
            (Fn−1)*(Fn+1) − F2n= (−1)^n
     2 .  The "addition" rule:
            Fn+k=(Fk * Fn+1) + (Fk−1 * Fn)
     3 . Applying the previous identity to the case k=n, we get:
            F2n= Fn * (Fn+1 + Fn−1)
     4 . From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer k, Fnk is multiple of Fn.
     5 . The inverse is also true: if Fm is multiple of Fn, then m is multiple of n
     6 . GCD identity:
            GCD(Fm,Fn) = FGCD(m,n)
